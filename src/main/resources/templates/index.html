            <h2 class="landing">UK Patent Renewal Rules</h2>
            <p>Renewal fees are due for UK patents starting from the 4th anniversary of the patent
                filing date. This first payment is for the 5th year of the patent, so this fee is known
                as the 5th annuity or 5th renewal fee. After the first payment, they are due annually
                every year thereafter until the end of the patent lifetime, 20 years after filing. If
                the patent is not yet granted at the 4th anniversary of the filing date (or strictly
                speaking at 3 years and 9 months), the fee is not payable, but will accrue with
                subsequent renewals for payment at the time of grant of the patent. We suggest you pay
                these accrued fees through your filing agent, and then RenewalsDesk will make payments
                from the next annuity. Please refer to the dedicated article on Late Grants in the
                Knowledge Base for further information.</p>
            <p>There is a grace period of six months after the initial deadline in which to pay the fee,
                but late fees are charged, accruing at an additional £24 per month.</p>
            <p>After the end of this six month grace period, if the renewal fee is not paid, the patent
                right lapses. Reinstatement is possible, but only if there has been a genuine error
                which caused the lapse of the patent. So this can not be relied upon to reinstate lapsed
                patents where the patent owner was aware of the requirement to pay the fee but chose not
                to take action to have the fee paid.</p>
